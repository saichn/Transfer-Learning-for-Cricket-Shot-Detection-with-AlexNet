# Transfer-Learning-for-Cricket-Shot-Detection-with-AlexNet
This project demonstrates the application of deep learning and transfer learning techniques to classify cricket shots using a pre-trained AlexNet model in PyTorch. By leveraging transfer learning, the project fine-tunes AlexNet, originally trained on the ImageNet dataset, for a custom cricket shot detection task.
